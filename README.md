# Horiseon Web Services

## Description

- Horiseon Web Services web page displays services of fictional company but the html featured mostly divs and no semantic html and redundant css
- I Replaced non-semantic divs with semantic elements such as nav, section, article, main, etc. Combined reused css into logical classes and edited html with new classes
- By replacing non-semantic html tags with semantic ones, it increases accessibility and helps with SEO. Additionally reworked CSS helps to maintain clean code and helps with maintainability 
- I learned about general HTML structure and understanding when/where/why to use semantic html. Additionally I learned about the process of reading other code and working with it to keep the site working functionally while changing the CSS and html
